# Open_Intelligence-
This is an open source project to create artificial intelligence. See the readme for more details. Let's make this awesome!

NOTE: THIS README IS MOSTLY A TODO LIST, AS WELL AS DISCUSSING IDEAS. IF YOU HAVE ONE, ADD IT ON THE README!
NOTE(also): AT THE MOMENT, I AM ADDING MY ENTIRE VISUAL STUDIO 2013 ULTIMATE PROJECT IN REPO. ONCE I GET CMAKE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY, WE WILL BE USING THIS. THE GOAL IS TO MAKE THIS CROSS-PLATFORM!

First things first, In order for this to work, we are going to need to write a program that can create other programs,
then we need to hotswap these programs so that it acquires this new way of thinking, hopefully simulating adaptation.


The purpose of this project is to attempt to make a fully working AI, one that functions like a human.
To do this, we need to understand both the psychology and the neural networking of humans.
Below will be a list of psychological sequences, and things to potentially build in the program
